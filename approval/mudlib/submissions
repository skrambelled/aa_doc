Mudlib projects are submitted at and tracked by the approval clerk in the Qc
office. However, all review of the project will in general be done by Mudlib.
Mudlib projects that have World impact must pass a World review. Once a
project is passed to Mudlib, an entry in the Mudlib job list will be created
(goto /d/Mudlib/room/adm, 'jlist').

It is advisable to consult Mudlib early on in the design phase of your
project, to ensure that effort is not wasted working on a file that would
need major rewriting or other work to be finally implemented.
