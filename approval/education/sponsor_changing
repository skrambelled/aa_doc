You may change sponsors due to time zone conflicts, personality conflicts,
and/or your sponsor disappearing (failing to log in regularly, demoting,
getting banished).

How to change your sponsor:
  Find a new sponsor who agrees to sponsor you.
  Formally mail your sponsor with the reasons you are changing
  sponsors.
  Contact the Senate, and have your proposed sponsor
  do the same.
