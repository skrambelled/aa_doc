A Presponsor is an active level 750+ that agrees to be responsible in
concert with a Sponsor for determining when an Apprentice is ready for
full wizard status.

It is important that a full wizard is adequately prepared for the path
ahead and is able to take advantage of the new learning opportunities that
full wizardhood provides.

A full wizard should have knowledge of our rules, programming language
(LPC), wizard commands, and be able to comfortably navigate the wizard
environment.

The Presponsor shall ask the Apprentice to demonstrate this by a variety of
tasks including coding some non-trivial part of the idea(s) the Apprentice 
wishes to bring to fruition.
