A sponsor is a Creator level (600) or higher immortal who agrees to
assist and guide an Apprentice (400) on his or her journey to Creator.
After meeting the requirements (see presponsor in this
directory) and being pre-sponsored by a wizard of level 750+,
the Apprentice may be sponsored to Wizard (500).
