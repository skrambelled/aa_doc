A sponsor may withdraw sponsorship for a variety of reasons including 
poor behavior, coding inactivity, personality conflicts, time zone
conflicts, etc.  Naturally, this is not something to be done frivolously, 
as the sponsoree will have to meet level 500 promotion requirements again.
If your sponsoree is an an actively coding wizard, you should consider 
suggesting to them that they find another sponsor so they do not have 
to be presponsored again.

How to withdraw your sponsorship:
  Formally mail your sponsoree with the reasons you are withdrawing your
  sponsorship.
  Contact the Senate.
