You will need to have a sponsor to get your level once
you have have been presponsored by an 750+ wizard
Your sponsor will take you through the steps to become a
full Wizard. 

Finding a Sponsor

  The sponsor/sponsoree relationship is important.  Choose 
  carefully.  A sponsor must be Creator level or higher.
  This is someone you can ask for advice, coding 
  help, motivation, and inspiration.  Your sponsor should 
  look out for you if you are treated unfairly or have
  difficulties with approval process admins, or any general
  wizard troubles.

Qualites you should look for in a sponsor:

  * Someone you can freely talk to about anything.
  * Generally online when you are.
  * Online often enough to provide the support you need.
  * Knowledgeable about wizard rules, approval process, lpc.
  * Knowledgeable about the various wizard tools.
  * Someone who is an example of the kind of creator you'd
    like to become.

How do I ask someone to be my sponsor?

  "Are you currently taking sponsorees? If so, what kind 
   of requirements would you have for a sponsoree?" works
   rather well.

Help!  I don't know any Creator+ wizards.  Now what?

  Your mentor or a Senator/Arch can help you find a sponsor. 
  Frequently, Creators+ will ask about promising apprentices
  to sponsor.  Don't panic.  You'll be able to find a sponsor.
