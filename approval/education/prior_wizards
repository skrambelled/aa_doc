Prior wizards are Apprentices who have been:
  * Demoted to Apprentice for inactivity
  * Demoted due to their sponsor withdrawing sponsorship
  * Wizards demoted to mortal by law or at their own request and are returning

These immortals still fall under the category of apprentice (per 'help 
wizrules'), and should take special care that their mortal alts are 
suicided or frozen, and their autoloading wizard tools are destructed.  To
get files moved from old wizard directories, contact the Senate.
