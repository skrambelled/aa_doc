NOTE: Please read the general document on uniques before reading further.
ALSO: Does your weapon really need to be unique?


Unique weapons typically have a higher weapon class and/or parry than the
ranges specified for that type of weapon in the balance weapons document.

Balance encourages new unique weapons to be different to the standard 'really
good sword' type of unique. Why not have unique abilities, class-specific
bonuses, race-specific bonuses, or interesting combat effects using hooks?
What about a weapon that gives bonuses other than ones that help directly in
combat? Or, you could create a 'hand-and-a-half' weapon (see man
hand_and_half).

Bear in mind that unique weapons will be really expensive (value starts at
2000 coins), so only high-level monsters will be able to hold/guard unique
weapons.
