Balance is encouraging diversity and originality with regards to healing in
an area. We're always prepared to discuss your ideas, but any healing rooms,
shops, pubs, monsters or non-food non-drink objects MUST be approved by the
Arch of Balance prior to submission. You will need to justify this healing in
detail.

As the map expands, we will allow more healing rooms, shops and pubs, but we
will not allow for too many in a small amount of map space.

We can be flexible with some speciality or atmospheric foods, such as wedding
food/drink. In some cases, your balancer may suggest minimal or no healing.
Be prepared to have to justify the foods you want.

We would expect you to be realistic with your healing formulae, costs and
quantity per player per reset.

All cases will be dealt with on an individual basis and we will try and work
with you to preserve, as far as possible, your original desires.


The Balance team.
