** Epic Monsters **:
====================

An "epic" monster is one of level 20 to 25. Epic monsters are the most
difficult monsters in the game. The solo player does not stand a chance,
as it will be a challenge for a party of experienced players to kill an
epic monster. For those that do manage to kill an epic monster, the
bragging rights are almost as valuable as the experience and treasure.

There must be a logical and thematic reason why your monster is so
powerful.

Epic monsters MUST be a challenge for a party of experienced players.
Minimum standards are given at the end of this document, but your epic
monster will be extensively tested to make sure that it provides enough
of a challenge. Things to watch out for include: smites from saintly
paladins against negative-aligned monsters, the cleric destruct prayer
against undead, and the lightning spell of mages when outdoors.

On the subject of challenge, do not not simply make your epic monster
do a lot of spell or weapon damage. This is extremely boring and will
simply result in players drinking millions of potions, which takes no
skill at all. Suggestions for other forms of challenge include: self-
healing, tripping, disarming, using thrown weapons or bows, elemental
damage, and spells that have an effect over more than one combat round.

Epic monsters must not instantly kill inexperienced players that do not
understand what they are up against. There are numerous ways to prevent
this, including blocking players from the part of your area where the
epic monster resides, making your monster scare players away, or having
your monster refuse to fight players below a certain level.

To get to an epic monster, players must kill a 'high-level monster' (see
the 'highlevelmonsters' file in this directory). The usual restrictions
on the high-level monster apply, including the need for it to have a
guard. Epic monsters count as one high-level monster, for the purposes
of calculating how large your area must be, so currently you need to
get Balance permission for the epic monster and have a minimum of 25
rooms.

Another restriction on epic monsters is that the maximum level of any
monster on the Anguish map is 21. The maximum in the Westmap expansion
is 23, and the maximum on the Infidian expansion is 25.

** NOTE: Currently, no epic monsters will be approved for the existing
         Anguish map, as we would like to encourage more areas for the
         Infidian and Westmap expansions.

Epic monsters have an impressively high treasure value. To avoid a flood
of ridiculously powerful equipment, the treasure value must be split
between a few different items. A suggestion to get players coming back
to die to... err, to fight your epic monster: have a number of different
sets of equipment, and randomly spawn different sets on it. Players will
return to complete the set and/or try out the other equipment available.

The 150% rule does not apply to epic monsters.

The table that follows represents BARE MINIMUM values. You epic monster
should be much more creative than simply setting the values per the
table below.
