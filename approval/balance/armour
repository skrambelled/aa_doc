----------------------=> Armour Guidelines <=-----------------------

What follows is a set of guidelines for the creation of armours for
use in the game of Ancient Anguish. Although not by any means strict
limits, nearly every armour should fall within the guidelines put 
forward here.

Over the course of development, armour on AA has become something
different from what it is supposed to be for.  Balance is 
attempting to correct this problem and bring armour class values 
and weights back into line.  Below you will find definition of
what we expect to become the norm for armour.  That is, a 
piecemeal armour system rather than near-weightless composites.
This means that instead of armour like fine platemail which covers
multiple parts of the body in one object, players would have to 
kill 3-4 monsters to get a chestpiece, sleeves, leggings, and a 
collar to get the same AC value.  As you create areas, keep in 
mind that the demand for well-made single piece armours will be 
on the rise in the near future.

Armour Type:

  string set_armour_type();

  This effectively determines where the armour is worn. If the armour type
  is set as "armour", as most should, it will take up armour slots as 
  displayed by the 'eq' command. If the armour is not regular armour like 
  this, then this variable may be set to other values, usually the type of 
  item that the object is. These are the common ones that get used:
  "amulet" denotes that the item is worn around the neck.
  "ring" denotes that the item is worn on the fingers.
  "back" denotes that the item is worn on the back.
  
Armour Class:
  
  int set_armour();

  This sets the average level of protection that the item of armour gives
  if it is armour type "armour". In general, the class of armour is
  determined by its predominant material composition and NOT necessarily
  it's armour class. Depending on what you set here, armour will defend
  better against certain attack types. For example, SOFT_LEATHER armour
  protects better against slashing attacks, but does not protect very well
  against crushing attacks (see the armour_table document for more details).

  NOTE: To do this, '#include <armour_lib.h>' and set_armour(); to the most
        suitable define for the armour.
  ALSO: The armour classes are given as a guide ONLY and are not inextricably
        linked to the description/define.
        For example, you could code a PLATEMAIL helmet with armour class 3.

  For head/hbody/legs/arms:

        5   Magical 

  For light body

        AC  Description                        <armour_lib.h> define
        --------------------------------------------------------------  
        1   Cloth or Scraggly Fur              THIN_CLOTH
        2   Thick Cloth or Regular Fur         THICK_CLOTH

        4   Leather or Fine Fur                LEATHER   
        5   Magical 
 
Armour Protection:
  
  int set_head_ac();
  int set_hbody_ac();
  int set_leg_ac();
  int set_arm_ac();

  Determines the amount of protection the armour gives to the head, body,
  legs and arms repsectively. The value should range between 1 and 15, 
  with 15 being reserved for magical and usually unique items. If you are
  unsure what level your armour classes should be, the tables above can be
  used as a guide as to the amount of protection for each type of material.

  int set_neck_ac();
  int set_lbody_ac();
  int set_foot_ac();
  int set_hand_ac();

  Determines the amount of protection the armour gives to the neck, body,
  feet and hands respectively. The value should range between 1 and 5, 
  with 5 being reserved for magical and usually unique items. If you are
  unsure what level your armour classes should be, the tables above can be
  used as a guide as to the amount of protection for each type of material.

Armour Weight:

  int set_weight();

  The weight a piece of armour should be can be calculated using the 
  following formula: 
  
  Weight = (total acs of 1-15 ac areas / 6) + (total acs of 1-5 ac areas / 4) +
           (number of areas covered over 1) + 1.
   
  For example: 
    Some platemail with leg ac 13, arm ac 13, hbody ac 13 and neck ac 4
    Weight = (13+13+13 / 6) + (4 / 4) + (3) + 1 = 11.  

  NOTE: In doing the divisions of these calculations, one should always
        round down. ie. 11/6 = 1.

Armour Value: 

  To obtain the value of the armour, use either Wandus by telling wandus 
  <armour_name> whilst holding the armour, or ask a Balance assistant
  who will be glad to help you.

  For basic piece meal values, check the table below.

Values for Piecemeal Armour

  For Headt/Hbody/Legs/Arms

  AC   Value    AC   Value   Ac    Value
   1      5      6     50    11     225
   2      6      7     85    12     250
   3     12      8    150    13     285
   4     18      9    180    14     300
   5     24     10    200    15     350

  For Neck/Hands/Feet

  AC   Value
   1     25
   2     50
   3    125
   4    250
   5    350 

  If you have any questions regarding this document, please don't hesitate
  to ask your nearest Balance team member. Happy coding.

Armour Hooks:

  If you happen to use the hit_player hooks to modify the damage, a reduction
  of 1 is the equivalent of 3 ac for the damage reduction.

  If you use a hit_mod hook, then a change of 1 is the equivalent of 6 ac

  This should be taken into account when valuing the armour and for the
  maximum allowed values.
