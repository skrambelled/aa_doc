NOTE: Please read the general document on uniques before reading further.
ALSO: Does your armour really need to be unique?


Unique armours typically have high armour class in one or more locations.
There are already plenty of these in the game, so we would encourage
diversity of thought in creating unique armours.

Balance encourages new unique armours to be different to the standard 'really
good platemail' type of unique. Why not make a unique pair of gloves or
boots?

Also, you could make use of Tueblo's armour sets to create a nice set of
armour, but have the pieces on an npc that randomly spawns a different piece
each time. When put together, it might make a unique armour. See
/w/tueblo/toolbox/sets/sets.info for details.

Other features of a unique armour could be ability bonuses, however, be
aware that we have a large amount of magic resistance ability bonus items
already in the game and we are not likely to encourage any more.

You could also make use of hooks to create interesting combat effects. See
'man add_hook' for details. Please also check the armour.txt file for
hook return values and meanings.

The value of unique armours is very high, therefore your monster will need
to be a high level monster to incorporate this high value in its treasure
allowance.
