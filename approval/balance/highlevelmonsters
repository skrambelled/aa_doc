** High-Level Monsters **: 
==========================

A "high-level monster" is one of level 17 to 19. High-level monsters 
provide some of the greatest challenges to players, but they also are a rich
source of potential game imbalances. These guidelines will help avoid those
imbalances.
 
The first question to consider is whether the monster needs to be high-level
monsters into their area to make it popular. Don't. Make your area 
interesting and fun to be in, not just a mindless source of experience 
points. Boring areas with a "standard level 19 monster" will not be approved.
 
Every high-level monster should be distinctive. This means it should have 
chats, spells, emotions, keywords, and basically every other little gizmo 
that our mudlib provides for monsters. These monsters should be truly 
exceptional. A level 17-19 npc MUST have the above. It is recommended that
high-level monsters behave more intelligently than a normal monster and
should be a challenge to a party, let alone an individual player. An example
would be a high-level mage who cast power word heal and quaffed extra healing
potions when it was hurt.
 
** All high-level monsters MUST be guarded. **

Many experienced players spend their time on 'the circuit', going from one 
easy high experience area to the next. The monsters on the circuit are 
high-level, with no challenge in getting to them. Adding a monster to this 
circuit will not be allowed. There must be some lower-level monsters, 
puzzles, mini-quests, locked doors, or other barriers between players and a 
high-level monster. Note that one easy monster or one locked door will not 
be enough to satisfy this requirement. Make the players do some work to get
to the big experience point challenge. If a high-level monster in your area
has a unique, it should be especially well hidden and defended.

There are limits on the number of level 17-19 monsters that you can have per
area. They are based on the number of rooms in the area as follows:

 < 16 rooms = No level 17-19 monsters
17-24 rooms = 1 level 17-19 monster
25-32 rooms = two level 17-19 monsters
33 +  rooms = permission needed from Balance for more level 17-19 monsters

NOTE: Your high-level monster/s MUST have varied weapon class, armour class
      and healthpoints (not just the minimum stated in the monster document).
      If you require assistance with this, your balancer will help if asked.
      We encourage coders to take advantage of the higher treasure level and
      be adventurous when coding armour and weapons for high-level monsters.
