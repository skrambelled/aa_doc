** How many monsters can I have in my area? **:
==============================================

Monsters should occur in areas at a ratio of EITHER 2.25 rooms per monster,
OR 70 healthpoints per room.

The 70 health points per room ratio is a fairly new concept to replace the
old 2 rooms to one monster ratio for newbie areas. It also allows more npcs
in the majority of mid-level areas.

For example, in a 21-room (creator size) area, you can have a maximum of 1470
health points. For a newbie area, this would mean that you could have 21
level one monsters OR 18 level 2 npcs OR three level 5 monsters, two level 4
monsters, four level 3 monsters, two level 2 monsters, and six level 1
monsters. If you used the 2.25:1 rule, the maximum number of monsters in the
area is nine.

NOTE: Please read the monster_table document.


** Miscellaneous **:
===================

 If your monster drops/returns/destructs objects when given by a player, be
sure to remove/add the weight of the object. Otherwise, you could end up with
abusable/annoying weight bugs.

  Another hint: set_level() will automatically set the minimum values of the
following: wc, any ac, hp, stats, skills, parrying, blocking, resistances,
experience. Note that we are unlikely to pass an npc with LOWER values than
the minimum, unless there is a reason and something to counterbalance the
lower value.

For more information, see the high-level monster, unkillable monster, undead
and alignment documents in this directory.
