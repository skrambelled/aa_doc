NOTE: Please read /doc/build/unique when coding your unique.

A unique is an object that is so powerful/different that there can be only
one version at a time.

Uniques are very rare and need to remain that way. However, we would never
deter anyone from coding a unique as long as that object necessitated being a
unique. Most objects do not. Also, your area must have a theme which
justifies the existence of your unique.

Generally, the value of a unique starts at 2000 coins. This means that it has
to be either on or guarded by a high-level monster whose treasure allows it.
We prefer uniques to also be part of a puzzle, quest, miniquest, series of
kills, etc, rather than just killing the one monster.

We occasionally have low-level uniques, these are EXTREMELY rare and very
difficult to justify. However, if your reasoning allows it and it fits into
the theme of your area and the game, it could be a possibility.

NOTE: If you would like to have an object as a unique in your area, you MUST
      discuss this with, and get approval from, the Arch of Balance.

ALSO: Balance will not allow any stat-boosters at present. (Good alternatives
      may involve the use of add_hook).
