-----------------------=> Weapon Guidelines <=-----------------------

What follows is a set of guidelines for the creation of weapons for
use in the game of Ancient Anguish. Although not by any means strict
limits, nearly every weapon should fall within the guidelines put 
forward here.

Weapon Type:

  #include <weapon_lib.h>
  int set_weapon();

  This function sets the damage types of the weapon and should be set
  depending on which category of weapon skills the use of the weapon would
  fall under. Weapon categories are: 
    longsword, shortsword, axe, curved blade, two-handed sword,
    two-handed axe, spear, knife, staff, flail, club, rapier,
    polearm, exotic, markmanship, or unarmed

  Example:
    set_weapon(LONGSWORD);

Weapon Weight:

  int set_weight();

  The weight of a weapon has an effect on the amount of damage a
  sucessful hit with the weapon will incur. The weight of a weapon
  should be set somewhere within the guidlines given for its weapon
  type as shown in the table below, the exact number depending on 
  the specific weapon description. The weight is also generically
  based on its difficulty. Usually difficulty/5+1 weight.

  Example:
    set_weight(2);

Weapon Difficulty:

  int set_difficulty(); OR
  int set_class(); 

  Each weapon has a difficulty of use associated with it. Some weapon types
  are inherently more difficult to use than others. A range of difficulty
  values for each weapon type are shown in the table below, the specific 
  difficulty depending on the weapon description and how much damage the
  weapon does. The difficulty should be roughly equal to double the average
  damage the weapon does minus 1.

  NOTE: set_class() sets the difficulty of the weapon AND the damage, so if
        you use set_class(), you do not need to call set_damage().
        In general set_class is depreciated so is usually only used in old
        weapons.

  Example:
    set_difficulty(10);

Weapon Damage:

  mixed set_damage();
  int set_damage_bonus();

  Each weapon does an range of damage, the average amount of damage of
  which should be roughly equal to the weapons difficulty +1 divided by 2.
  Weapons that average damage 10 or above should be extremely rare and
  unique. The weapon damage defaults to the difficulty class of the
  weapon if set_class was used.
 
  Example:
    set_damage(15); would cause the weapon to do 1-15 damage, averaging 7.5.
    set_damage("d4+8"); would cause the weapon to do 9-13 damage, averaging 11.
    this would be equivalent to set_damage(4); set_damage_bonus(8);

  NOTE: It is the average damage the weapon does that is important. The range 
        of damage will determine how reliable the weapon is on any one swing. 
        If not explicitly set by set_damage(), the damage will be set auto-
        matically to the recommended value.  Thus a difficulty 5 weapon
        would automatically have Avg damage of 3. When using set_damage() 
        to set the damage value different from the recommended value, you 
        should stay relatively close to the recommended value, as an increase 
        to damage without an increase to difficulty is a big bonus to those 
        using the weapon.

Weapon Parry:

  int set_parry_ac();  

  Each weapon is different in its ability to be used to parry incoming 
  attacks. Some weapon types are inherently better for parrying with that
  others. A range of parry values for each weapon type are shown in the table
  below, the specific value depending on the weapon description and its
  difficulty to use. Weapons that have a parry ac of 19 or above should be
  extremely rare and unique.

  Example:
    set_parry_ac(12);

   _______________________________________________________________

   NOTE: Bear in mind that a high difficulty weapon will need a lot higher 
         skill in it to be used effectively and will hit a lot less often 
         that a weapon of moderate or low difficulty. However, on average, 
         they do hit harder.

Weapon Value:

  int set_value();  

  The value of a weapon is determined by the average damage that it will
  do on a sucessful hit, its parry ac and how much the average damage differs
  from half the diffulty of the weapon. 

       Difficulty | Average |             Parry  |   
         Class    | Damage: | Value         AC   | Value
      ------------------------------     ----------------
           20     |   10.5  |  N/A           20  |  N/A
           19     |   10    |  N/A           19  |  N/A
           18     |   9.5   |  935           18  |  410
           17     |   9     |  830           17  |  365 
           16     |   8.5   |  735           16  |  325
           15     |   8     |  645           15  |  285
           14     |   7.5   |  560           14  |  250
           13     |   7     |  485           13  |  215
           12     |   6.5   |  410           12  |  185
           11     |   6     |  345           11  |  155
           10     |   5.5   |  285           10  |  130
            9     |   5     |  230            9  |  105
            8     |   4.5   |  185            8  |   85
            7     |   4     |  140            7  |   65
            6     |   3.5   |  105            6  |   50
            5     |   3     |   75            5  |   35
            4     |   2.5   |   50            4  |   25
            3     |   2     |   35            3  |   15
            2     |   1.5   |   20            2  |   10
            1     |   1     |   15            1  |    5
                  |   0.5   |   10            0  |    0

  To obtain the base value of a weapon, add together the values of the 
  average damage and the parry ac as given in the above tables. 
  
  If double the average damage differs from the weapon difficulty +1, the 
  value must be modified by the percentage difference of 2* average damage 
  over the difficulty +1. 

  Example:

    A difficulty 8 weapon, parry ac 7 and average damage 5.
    Value = 285+65 = 350.
    2*average damage = 10; difficulty +1 = 8 +1 = 9.
    % Modifier = ((10-9)/9) * 100 = 10%
    Therefore final value = 350*110/100 = 385.

    A difficulty 17 weapon, parry ac 17, average damage 8.
    Value = 830+365 = 1195.
    2*average damage = 16; difficulty +1 = 17 +1 = 18.
    % Modifier = ((16-18)/18) * 100 = -12.5%
    Therefore final value = 1195*87.5/100 = 1045.

    This formula may seem a little complex, but if in doubt, Wandus should 
    be able to provide you with an accurate answer if you 'tell wandus
    <weaponname>' with the weapon in your inventory
