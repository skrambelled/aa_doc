------------------------=> Shield Guidelines <=-----------------------

NOTE: We positively encourage coders to consider creating shields for their
      monsters from low to high levels (not uniques).

What follows are some basic guidelines about how to create balanced
shields for use within Ancient Anguish. Although not strict limits, the
guidelines here should be followed in almost all cases.

Block AC:

  int set_block_ac();

  This function sets how good the shield is for blocking. The block AC
  should be set as a number between 1 and 20, 19 and 20 being reserved for
  unique and very powerful rare shields. Normally the value you set here
  should be determined by what 'type' of shield it is, some suitable examples
  of which are in the table below to act as guidelines.

  Shield Type    |   Block AC range  |  Description
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Buckler        |       1-10        | A very small round shield sometimes 
                 |                   | worn on the forearm.
  Small shield   |       3-12        | A small shield held in the hand 
  Targe shield   |       5-13        | A medium sized oval shield.
  Curved heater  |       7-15        | A tall, curved shield.
  Kite shield    |       7-15        | A shield shaped... like a kite!
  Tower shield   |      10-18        | A very tall shield of average width.
  Wall shield    |      10-18        | A very wide shield of average height.  

Shield weight:

  int set_weight();

  The weight of a shield should be somewhat proportional to its blocking
  class but modified by what material it is made of. A good weight for a 
  shield would be its block_ac divided by 4 rounded up.

  Example:
    A shield block_ac 3 should have a weight of 3/4 rounded up = 1.
    A shield block_ac 15 should have a weight of 15/4 rounded up = 4.

Shield value:

  int set_value();

  The value of a shield is determined by its block_ac and can be modified
  a little for an unusual weight or craftsmanship. Suitable shield values
  are listed in the table below.

  Block AC |  Value  | Block AC |  Value  | Block AC |  Value 
  --------------------------------------------------------------
      1    |    10   |     8    |   200   |    15    |   600
      2    |    25   |     9    |   250   |    16    |   675
      3    |    50   |    10    |   300   |    17    |   750
      4    |    75   |    11    |   350   |    18    |   825
      5    |   100   |    12    |   400   |    19    |   N/A
      6    |   125   |    13    |   450   |    20    |   N/A
      7    |   150   |    14    |   525
