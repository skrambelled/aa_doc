Most features are self-explanatory in the document mentioned at the top and
your balancer will work with you with the values.

NOTE: The use of destruct and turn in high-level monsters will be a very rare
      occurance. Be ready with your reasons for using them.


Here is a table of the values for set_turn():

Npc level         Min turn level     Max turn chance   Level 19 chance

NOTE: Please consider how annoying scare will be to players when setting your
      values.
ALSO: Drain experience should only be used on high-level monsters UNLESS you
      have a justifiable reason to use it in a lower level monster.
