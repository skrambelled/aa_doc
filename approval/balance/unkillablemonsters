As a rule, no monsters are unkillable. However, there may be circumstances
(i.e. shopkeepers in new parts of the map) where monsters need to be
unkillable to keep the game moving.

If you would like to deter players from killing your npc, there are a number
of ways we can suggest you do so:
  - set_ep(0) - this means that the player gets no experience from the kill.
  - the monster carries no equipment or treasure.
  - in addition to the above, we can raise weapon class, armour class and
    healthpoints to a maximum to make the monster extremely difficult.

If you feel that your monster warrants being unkillable, please discuss this
with a balance member prior to submission.
