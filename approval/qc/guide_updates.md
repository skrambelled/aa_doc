# SYNOPSIS

If you would like to make an improvement/bug fix to some code that is already
installed into the game (projects accessible by mortals), whether it is your
own code or someone else's, then follow the steps outlined below.

---

## DESCRIPTION

Any bugs, typos, ideas, and praises that mortals have submitted using those
in-game commands can be found inside the /w/wizardname/log/ directory.

If the issue is a simple bug or typo then you can get any Arch to proofread
your changes and then with their approval proceed with installing the update.
Be aware that all changes are logged and trying to sneak in unapproved tweaks
can result in consequences.

If the tweak is complicated or could result in big changes to the mortal
experience, such as altering a monster's stats, or the stats on a weapon or
armour, you must officially submit the fix as a project to the queue with
proper documentation of what is changing and why.

If the code in question is not your own you must first check to see if the
author is still active and then speak with them about the issue. If they
would like to fix it themselves let them, or if they are okay with you doing
it then that is fine too, so long as you follow the proper steps to fix it.
This communication is important because a coder might be maintaining their
code offline and when they go to upload in the future it may overwrite it.

If the author is refusing to make a change, and the issue is negatively
affecting players, then speak to the Quality Control Arch about it.

Huge changes, such as revamping or replacing an entire area will require
special approval from the Senate, unless a "will" document is present inside
the owner's directory that specifies otherwise.

If you are in doubt or have any questions please ask the Quality Control Arch
before attempting to proceed with changes that might have repercussions or
are large in scope, even if they are necessary changes.
