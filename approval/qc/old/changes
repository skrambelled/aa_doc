                         Notes on changes to code by others
                    ======================================

You may want to make an improvement/bugfix to some code that is already
in the game, but was coded by some other wizard.  If you are the officially
appointed maintainer of the code of the wizard in question, fine....

Otherwise the text below applies to you.

If the coding wizard is still active, you should not even think about
submitting the change without talking to him/her first.  This is not
only because anything else would be very impolite, but also because
many wizards maintain their code offline, and might upload/overwrite
any changes made without their knowledge.

If the coding wizard is inactive, some special rules apply.

1) If you are changing files, avoid any unnecessary changes.  For
   example, do not make any changes to the formatting, even if it looks
   "ugly" to you.

   Why?

   Well, QC always compares the original file with the modified one,
   and formatting changes makes the file look very different, even if
   the differences are not "real".  A large 'diff' file means that the
   QC process will take much longer than otherwise.

2) Document the changes properly.  Projects like this should not just
   consist of the changed files, but also some .INFO files describing
   which changes were made and why they were made.

3) Any modified files should replace the older files and new files should
   generally be in the same directory as the original project.  There is
   one exception, though - a shopkeeper may be modified to sell an object
   from another wizard's directory.  What QC will generally not allow is
   something like a wizard replacing one room with a room located in his
   directory, changing the add_exit()s in adjacent rooms - this disrupts
   the overall integrity of the area.

Finally, if the changes involve replacing an entire area, you need special
approval.  Talk to the Senate members for information.
