                   Notes on fixing bugs in installed areas
                 ===========================================

The typo and bug reports for installed areas are logged to files in your
log directory, so doing something like

  tail /w/somewiz/log/Typo
  tail /w/somewiz/log/Bug
  tail /w/somewiz/log/Praise

(with your own name substituted for 'somewiz', of course), will list the
most recent reports.  Please fix them.  If you don't fix your typos,
someone else will have to be given write access to your installed areas
to fix them, and it is far preferable that the coder him/herself does the
job.

Now....

1) If you are just fixing a simple typo, just make the correction,
   and don't bother notifying QC or Balance.  You *should* however
   make sure you don't screw anything up, for example editing the
   file incorrectly, so it doesn't load.

2) If you are fixing an "obvious" bug, like adding a missing call to
   check_body_position() so players don't climb a tree while lying 
   down, you can go ahead and make the change, but document it in a  
   file named CHANGES or something like that.  If you are not sure if
   problem being fixed is in the "obvious bug" category, talk to
   someone in QC first.

3) If you are fixing a bug that does not really affect gameplay, but
   is not obvious either, you should let the QC or Balance Arch look
   at the change before it is implemented - make the change to a copy of
   the original file.

4) If the change is complicated, large or affects game play in any way
   (monster, armour or weapon stats), you MUST submit the fix as a
   project.  When submitting a fix, include the following information:

       name of original file(s)
       name of changed file(s)
       nature of the problem, and a description of the fix.
