Final Approval Checklist                            Feb 23 1998 Bytre
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the things checked for in final approval should be a thorough
coverage (wait, I'm trying to change.. ok, a spot check) of those
covered in the Alpha and Bravo checklists.  Final approval should only
be given after Balance approval has been given.  If the area is ready
for QC approval, Balance should be mailed to inform them that it is
waiting on Balance for final QC approval.  Above and beyond that, the
following final approval tasks must be completed:

-- An exploration flag should be added.  It should be named in the
   convention of (coder_project), such as bytre_wedshop.  Very minor
   additions to existing projects don't need exploration points added,
   but most standalone projects should, as should complex additions.
   For a very large and complex area, it is possible to have two
   exploration flags.  Exploration flags should be accessible to all - a
   guild should have the exploration flag somewhere in a publicly
   accessible area and shouldn't require the player to join it.  An
   exploration flag in a quest area should NOT be part of the quest
   solution.  It is OK to have an exploration flag given as the solve of
   a mini-quest, but it doesn't have to be there.  Add the flag in
   /secure/exploration, and test it.

-- Add a hint to Gaius, in /w/bytre/sage/hints.dat.  The format is:
   exploration flag #:Text of the hint:comment (coder's project name).
   You can solicit coder feedback for this.  It should be vague enough
   to be a challenge, but not so vague the player will never figure it
   out.

-- If the area is a quest, add it to the quest room in /room/quest_room.
   The value of the quest has pretty much fallen to QC to assign,
   although it may be appropriate to get Balance to assume this
   responsibility (or consult with them on it).  Bytre will generally
   ask the coder what they feel it should be worth, and compare it with
   the other quests.  He has completed or QCed all of the quests, so he
   has a good idea of where the value should fall.

-- Verify with World that the location in the query_x_coord and
   query_y_coord is accurate.

-- Inform necessary parties of the final approval.  Map should be
   mailed, guildmasters should be mailed if it is an addition to their
   guild (even if they are inactive, put some mail in their box), the
   original coder (in the case of an enhancement or rewrite or fix),
   and, of course, the coder.  The QC Arch should also be included in
   this mail.  If it is a mudlib project, it should be handed off to
   Mudlib and mudlib informed.

-- Implement the project.  This should only be done when the coder is
   present and will be around for a few hours to do any debugging or
   repair after implementation, which occasionally is needed.  If it is
   an enhancement or fix to an existing area, it is preferred to let the
   original owner of the area implement the fix, but this is not always
   practical.  If the area needs to be hooked up on the map, the Map
   Arch should be contacted to do the job.

-- Promotion of a Creator.  This is a duty which the QC Arch should
   perform, preferably when the Wizard's Sponsor is present.  The
   exception to this is when the Sponsor is a member of the Senate,
   Bytre likes to allow the Sponsor to do the promotion if practical.

-- Add an entry about the new area to /doc/helpdir/newstuff

-- If the wizard is promoted to creator, update "help credits" (/w/zor/adm/credits/
   rm the credits file in the dir, patch control do_the_list, cp credits to helpdir)
-- Ensure that the coder adds the project to the map book.

-- Whatever other tasks are needed to be done.
