                             INTRODUCTION
                             ------------

  <insert short description of project and how to get started with reviewing
   it>

  <insert locations of important documentation - the world.info and the
   balance.info especially>
  
                                -----
                                WORLD
                                -----

  <insert what you think world will find most problematic>
  <if you haven't yet negotiated with world where your area will go, 
   insert some options you think are suitable for where the area is to go>

                                -----
                                ALPHA
                                -----

  <insert how much work you think this project holds for alpha reviewers.
   If the project is mostly code based with a few bits of chats and whatnot
   hiding in one or two specific places, point them to it>

                                -----
                                BRAVO
                                -----

  <insert how tough you think the code is for bravo reviewers. Outline where
   you think the code is mostly likely to go wrong. If the code is quite
   complex, an explanation of what you're doing and how you're doing it
   wouldn't go astray>

                                -------
                                BALANCE
                                -------

  <usually your concerns with balance go straight inside the balance.info>

                              --------------
                              IMPLEMENTATION
                              --------------

  <detail what needs to be done to implement your project - if it's an area,
   what rooms need to have code added to it? (or add_exits uncommented or
   #defines changed). If it's a fix to a bug in the game, what files need to 
   be overwritten? If it's quite a wide ranging project, what else needs to
   be changed in other code to accomodate this project?)>
   
  <If it's a mudlib or contrib project, where is the supporting
   documentation, where does it go, what are the projects that rely on this
   project going through?>

  <Finally, indicate what you would like to be put in "help newstuff" 
   (one-line description) and on the website (one paragraph) when the 
   project is installed. If you want a special announcement board post
   (e.g. appearing to be posted by an NPC) rather than posting it 
   yourself, provide the exact poster name and contents in a separate 
   file.>

                               EXPECTATIONS
                               ------------
                             
  <describe whether this project MUST be done before some time - ie, a
   Halloween themed project that must be finished before halloween. Detail
   if you will have big events coming up in your life that will affect
   how reviewers should treat your project (starting college, going on a
   long vacation, moving countries, etc). This way, reviewers know if they're
   working on a deadline and also will know when they don't need to be 
   looking at your project because you won't be active during that period
   anyway.>
