So you want to have something implemented on AA. Confused as to what to do?
Ask around. Any level 22+ wizard should know the process, but for general
help, read on.

There are all kinds of things to create - an area, an area with a quest, a
guild (monk, scythe, etc), or some other useful thing that might not fit
into any other category (like a single shop). This help will try to cover
all the possibilities, but again, ask around if you aren't sure.

I want to do something... but what?
     Read the Idea board for ideas. Also, read the planners board all the
     way through. See what people started, and see if others' ideas jog
     some of your own. Read the official AA history (/doc/world/AA_history)
     and see if there is some untold portion of AA's past that you would
     like to code. Remember that an area usually is at least 15 rooms in
     size, and should have its own "narrative" and purpose. Areas that
     are just hack'n'slash won't be approved, not will individual items or
     monsters not connected to areas.

I have an idea for a creation, I think...
     Post on the planners board. It is good for stirring up general opinions,
     reactions, suggestions. It is also good for discovering if someone is
     already making something similar. Take a look at the document /doc/world/
     creation. If you are really unsure if an idea fits into theme, or will be 
     accepted, or is 'do-able,' ask World for a quick opinion,  and Balance 
     or QC for the little details.


Ok, I definitely have an idea!
     Get your concept checked out and approved. Take a look at the doc 
     starting_an_area in /doc/world. Contact World (mail world) to make 
     sure your idea fits in to theme and to get some opinions and 
     suggestions about the idea in general. World wants a documentation 
     file describing your idea, which discusses theme, looks and history.
     The file /doc/world/World.Concept_guidelines will give the
     information needed to create that documentation file.

World liked it and I've got a couple of approved ideas. What now?
     Read all the docs unless you are Mr(s) LPC. Beware of old, outdated docs
     (use ls -l to see the creation dates). ESPECIALLY read doc/build/style,
     and /doc/begin/. Use a baseroom! Read the Reference board to see what
     makes AA special (and USE it!) Take a look at /doc/lfun to learn the
     local functions that you can use; these are the "vocabulary" of building
     on AA. Make a few things, and have other wizzes look at them to make 
     sure you're doing it all correctly. If you are thinking of making a guild, 
     prepare a complete doc with all your plans, then mail the Balace Arch 
     (Arpeggio) and have him look at it. LPC-newbies will want to peek in 
     people's open dirs for helpful docs and examples (also /doc/examples).
     Greyson has opened the dir of his quest as well (/w/greyson/ruins).
     The files of Sully's lighthouse area are also open for reading (/w/sully/
     lighthouse).

Hmm.. I've made a few things, but am I doing it right?
     Again, show your work around, asking your sponsor and other creators
     who have gone through the approval process. This is to make sure you 
     are on the right track. Read /doc/build/balance, and all the files in
     /doc/balance/ and /d/Balance/open to know what Balance wants from you.
     The docs in /doc/quality will also describe the sorts of things that
     Qc looks for, such as explanation of "describe-all", etc.

I'm almost done. I think...
     Prepare the BALANCE.INFO doc for Balance (as described in 
     /doc/build/balance). Prepare the WORLD.INFO doc for World.

I'm done!
     Maybe. Grab a wiz-friend and let them loose in your area, have them report
     any problems and typos they find. Everything had better clone on the first
     try!

I'm really done! Trust me.

     Congrats! Mail Qc and tell them you are ready to be Qc'd. Include the
     path to the start room, the dirs that all relevant obj/npcs are in, and
     any docs you have made about the area. Mail World to initiate their review
     process. Mail Balance and ask to be balanced. Visit the clerks in the Qc 
     and Balance offices (/d/Qc/room/office and /d/Balance/room/office) and 
     put your project into the approval queue!
     Be prepared for the approval process to take a while (ask any 22). 
     Prepare an entrance room file (ask World for guidance.) Don't be
     surprised if Qc wants you thoroughly balanced before they'll finish 
     Qc'ing. Finally, after the area is approved, contact Map to get a map 
     spot and the area implemented and in the game!
