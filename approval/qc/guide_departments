INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The four departments that oversee approval of projects in the queue are
World, Quality Control, Balance, and Map. If you have questions you can mail
those departments using 'mail <world/qc/balance/map>' respectively, and a
team member will reply.

DEPARTMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of the World department is to make sure that the game's overall
theme is maintained, and to create a cohesive and consistent theme that is
free of cliches or otherwise undesirable features.

The purpose of the Quality Control department is to make sure that each
project is coded according to the established standards, is free of typos and
grammatical errors, is free of bugs, and provides an intuitive and highly
polished experience for players.

The purpose of the Balance department is to make sure that the project's
monsters and objects of all types are both reasonable for the level and
difficulty of the area, and also consistent with the established guidelines.

The purpose of the Map department is to make sure the layout of the landscape
around Oerthe is cohesive and consistent, and fits the game's theme.

Use 'help wizardlist' to see a list of the departments and their members.
